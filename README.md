# Neutron
Build apps with c# and web technologies using webview

# Prerequisite Windows
- Node js, install it from https://nodejs.org/en or use NVM (Node Version Manager) to easily install and manage multiple nodejs installations https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows
- Dotnet SDK, use the version you want to target, this framework support .Net 7, and 8 https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/
- Enable Loopback, you need to enable the Loopback to make webview works on windows, run `CheckNetIsolation LoopbackExempt -a -n="Microsoft.win32webviewhost_cw5n1h2txyewy"` with an elevated permission powershell, your user of your application also need to do that, it's recommended to use an installer when distributing your application so you can enable loopback in the installation script 

# Prerequisite Linux
- Node js, install it from https://nodejs.org/en or use NVM (Node Version Manager) to easily install and manage multiple nodejs installations https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm
- Dotnet SDK, use the version you want to target the framework support .Net 7, and 8 https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/
- libwebkit2gtk and libgtk-3, install using your distro package manager for debian use `sudo apt install -y libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libgtk-3-dev` and fedora use `sudo dnf install webkit2gtk4.0-devel gtk3-devel` if you distribute the application on linux the user of your application also need to install it

# Initializing The Project
Download the [neutroncli](https://github.com/NeutronFramework/Neutron/releases)<br/><br/>
or for windows you can also use chocolatey, launch an elevated powershell and type<br/>
```choco install neutroncli```<br/><br/>
or download the chocolatey package from [neutroncli](https://github.com/NeutronFramework/Neutron/releases) make a folder, put the package inside, launch an elevated powershell, and type<br/>
```choco install neutroncli --source "path/to/folder/containing/chocolatey"```<br/><br/>
for flatpak you need to install it using sudo for example<br/>
```sudo flatpak install neutroncli_0.2.0_x86_64.flatpak```<br/><br/>
also for flatpak after the installation you need to run<br/>
```sudo ln -s /var/lib/flatpak/app/com.annasvirtual.neutroncli/current/active/files/bin/neutroncli /usr/local/bin/neutroncli```<br/><br/>
this will create a symbolic link to make neutroncli command accessible system wide<br/>
this is because flatpak uses a sandboxed environment<br/>

open the terminal and type<br/>
```neutroncli init```<br/>

fill out the option or you can pass it directly<br/>
```neutroncli init --name ProjectName --dotnet-version net8 --framework react_ts```<br/>

# Running The Project
cd to the project directory and type `neutroncli run`<br/>
or you can go to the c# project directory and type `dotnet run`<br/>
or open the c# project on your favorite IDEs and press run<br/><br/>
you can also run the frontend independently for fast ui iteration and hot reload<br/>
go to the project-name-frontend folder and type `npm run dev`<br/>

# Building The Project
cd to the project directory and type <br/>
```neutroncli build```<br/><br/>
or pass it directly <br/>
```neutroncli build --platform win_x64 --build-mode release --self-contained```<br/><br/>
or you can go to the c# project directory part and type<br/>
```dotnet publish --configuration Release --runtime win-x64 --self-contained```<br/><br/>
i recommend you distribute your application using an installer or a package manager<br/>
so that it can enable loopback on windows or install webkit2gtk on linux during app installation<br/>
so the user wouldn't need do anything extra<br/>
i might add `neutrocli package` that package the app automatically and do everything that it need to run in the installer so you don't have to
